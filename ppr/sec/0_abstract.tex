    Image segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision with significant applications in various fields such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and object detection. Accurate segmentation allows for precise identification and localization of objects within an image, which is essential for tasks that require detailed scene understanding. In this project, we aim to compare the performance of different image segmentation models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Convolutional Networks (GraphCNNs), and Transformers. Our goal is to evaluate their effectiveness and identify the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in the context of image segmentation. This literature survey was greatly inspired by \cite{9356353}.
