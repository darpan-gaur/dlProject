\section{Problem Statement}
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of CNN, Transformer, and GNN-based approaches for image segmentation. These models will be evaluated using the dataset mentioned in the dataset section.  By leveraging the strengths of these architectures, we seek to identify their respective advantages and shortcomings. In addition to evaluating these architectures, we will implement a series of experiments designed to improve segmentation outcomes. Also, use the above analysis to the ongoing Kaggle competition focused on segmenting vasculature in 3D scans of human kidneys \cite{kaggle_competition}.
