\section{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item TransUnet performs the best in terms of \texttt{mIoU} on the validation and test sets.
    \item Even though Mask2Former claim to be better than MaskFormer, it shows only marginal improvement in terms of \texttt{mIoU} on this dataset.
    % \item Interestingly, the absolute value of loss for Mask2Former is much higher as compared to MaskFormer 
    \item Mask2Former (occupies 412M space on disk) has more parameters than MaskFormer (occupies 393M space on disk) which makes it slightly slower for fine-tuning and inference.
    \item CNNG performs better than Graph-FCN which shows the effectiveness of using the GAT network.
\end{itemize}
